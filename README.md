# Automatic-Valve-for-Controlling-Water-Supply-in-Residential-Areas

## Overview
Implemented an innovative solution to address the challenges of limited and uneven water supply in residential areas. The project involved the design and development of an automatic solenoid valve system controlled by an Arduino UNO board. This system ensures equal water distribution to each house, eliminating timing constraints and pressure variations.

## Features
- Equal distribution of water to each house.
- Flexible timing of water supply.
- Automatic reset every 24 hours.

## Achievements
Successfully simulated and implemented the system, integrating components like YF-S201 Flow Rate Sensor and 4x4 Matrix Keypad.
Conducted surveys and expert consultations to understand real-world issues, guiding the project's development.
Cost-effective solution applicable to residential buildings, industries, and water supply networks.
